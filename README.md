# Xiaomi MIUI 14 Global 14.0.9 Debloat List (DEC 2024)
If you're frustrated with the pre-installed applications on your new phone, you're not alone. Many of these apps can be redundant or intrusive, often causing issues such as push notifications and excessive battery drain.

By using ADB (Android Debug Bridge), you can safely remove these unwanted applications without the need for rooting. This method is less risky than manual removal and ensures that system variables remain intact, allowing you to continue receiving OTA updates without issues.

This script is designed to help Xiaomi phone users remove unnecessary pre-installed applications and bloatware from their devices. 
By running this script, you can declutter your phone, improve performance, and free up storage space.
